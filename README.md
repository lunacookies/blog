# website

This repo used to contain the Make A Language series, which is now in [lunacookies/lang](https://github.com/lunacookies/lang). At the moment, all that’s here is a small personal homepage that mainly serves to redirect visitors to [lunacookies.github.io/lang](https://lunacookies.github.io/lang). The whole Hugo setup with fancy minification I have going here is complete overkill, which I’m keeping because I already had it set up, and (cliché incoming) also since maybe someday I want to write some blog posts and this would be a good place to keep them.
