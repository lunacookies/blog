title: "My Webfont Contradiction"

I’ve seen lots of tech people complain online
about how websites are becoming
increasingly bloated.
I understand this sentiment,
completely.

One of the culprits which is often mentioned
(alongside invasive advertising
and mountains of JavaScript)
is (are?) webfonts.
I’ve seen them be derided for being
a pointless waste of hundreds of kilobytes
or perhaps even megabytes of bandwidth
per page load,
solely to cultivate a “brand image”
or because some designer
thought they looked nice.

In today’s era of `system-ui` & co,
beautiful typography is possible in browsers
without loading any external typefaces.
Does anyone have
an excuse to use webfonts anymore?

This website used to just use Georgia.
I’m a typography and type design nerd, though.
I couldn’t resist picking some pretty typefaces
and updating my website to use them.

Can you tell the difference between
the font I’ve used and some random built-in font?
Do you care?
Are you at least mildly annoyed
I used up 118 kilobytes of _your_ data
to load these fonts
because _I_ like them?
Or am I being completely reasonable,
since this is, after all,
my website and my form of
personal creative expression?
