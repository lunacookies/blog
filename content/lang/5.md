After [Part Four](/lang/4), the longest so far, this will be a relatively short post: we’ll be adding support for binding usages. Here’s the syntax we’re after:

```
let a = 10
let b = a
```

where `a` is a binding usage.

# Parsing

Let’s begin with the parser. Add `pub mod binding_usage;` to `lib.rs`, and create a new file at `src/binding_usage.rs`. As usual, we’ll start with a test:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn parse_binding_usage() {
        assert_eq!(
            BindingUsage::new("abc"),
            Ok((
                "",
                BindingUsage {
                    name: "abc".to_string(),
                },
            )),
        );
    }
}
```

Let’s add the definition of `BindingUsage`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct BindingUsage {
    name: String,
}
```

Since the syntax we’re using for binding usages is to simply write out the name of the binding being used,[^1] all `BindingDef::new` has to do is call `utils::extract_ident`:

```rust
use crate::utils;

// snip

impl BindingUsage {
    pub fn new(s: &str) -> Result<(&str, Self), String> {
        let (s, name) = utils::extract_ident(s)?;

        Ok((
            s,
            Self {
                name: name.to_string(),
            },
        ))
    }
}
```

Let’s check if the parser is working as expected:

```
$ cargo t -q
running 25 tests
.........................
test result: ok. 25 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

Now that the parser is working, we can move on to evaluating these binding usages.

# Evaluation

It’s been a while since we covered evaluation, so here’s how it works: binding names and their values are stored in the *evaluation environment,* or `Env`. Binding definitions add values to the `Env`, while binding usages reference these.

First, a test:

```rust
use crate::env::Env;
use crate::utils;
use crate::val::Val;

// snip

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    // snip

    #[test]
    fn eval_existing_binding_usage() {
        let mut env = Env::default();
        env.store_binding("foo".to_string(), Val::Number(10));

        assert_eq!(
            BindingUsage {
                name: "foo".to_string(),
            }
            .eval(&env),
            Ok(Val::Number(10)),
        );
    }
}
```

We create an empty environment, and then declare a binding with the name `foo` and a value of `10`. After this, we try evaluating a binding usage of the binding with the name `foo`, and assert that it gives us `10`. Notice that the output of `.eval(&env)` is a `Result` -- this is because we want to return an appropriate error if the binding does not exist.

Let’s write the `eval` method:

```rust
impl BindingUsage {
    // snip

    pub(crate) fn eval(&self, env: &Env) -> Result<Val, String> {
        env.get_binding_value(&self.name)
    }
}
```

This calls a hypothetical `Env::get_binding_value` method, which we can write now:

```rust
// env.rs

impl Env {
    // snip

    pub(crate) fn get_binding_value(&self, name: &str) -> Result<Val, String> {
        self.bindings
            .get(name)
            .cloned()
            .ok_or_else(|| format!("binding with name ‘{}’ does not exist", name))
    }
}
```

We need to use `.cloned()` because `HashMap::get` returns a reference to the value, while we want ownership. Keep in mind that using strings for error messages, as we have been doing throughout this series, is unideal -- we’re doing it only because it makes our lives easier for now. Eventually we’ll restructure the project to use custom error enums with `Display` implementations, but that’s for another day.

This code doesn’t compile because `Val` doesn’t implement `Clone`, so let’s fix that:

```rust
// val.rs

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum Val {
    Number(i32),
}
```

We should add a test to verify that the error message for trying to evaluate a non-existent binding is correct:

```rust
// binding_usage.rs

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    // snip

    #[test]
    fn eval_non_existent_binding_usage() {
        let empty_env = Env::default();

        assert_eq!(
            BindingUsage {
                name: "i_dont_exist".to_string(),
            }
            .eval(&empty_env),
            Err("binding with name ‘i_dont_exist’ does not exist".to_string()),
        );
    }
}
```

And with that, we’re done:

```
$ cargo t -q
running 27 tests
...........................
test result: ok. 27 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

In the next instalment of the series, we’ll add support for blocks.

[^1]: This may seem painfully obvious if you haven’t used languages where this isn’t the case. In actuality, though, there are languages where accessing the value of a binding isn’t as simple as writing out the binding’s name: Bash, for example, insists[^2] you prefix the binding’s name with `$`.

[^2]: Yes, I know that the `$` is needed because Bash has bare words (how else would you tell if something is a usage of a binding or a bare word?), but who doesn’t like making fun of Bash’s syntax? (seriously though, I can never remember the difference (or lack thereof) between `if test condition`, `if [ condition ]` and `if [[ condition ]]`)
