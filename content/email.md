I constantly hear about
how much everybody hates email.
Look, I receive just as many spam messages
and useless email-based notifications
and stuffy vapid
“regarding my previous email”
work messages
as the next gal.
I&nbsp;get it.
But I’ve found
there’s something magical about email
as a medium of communication,
and as a technology.

As of late I’ve taken to
emailing random people about things they’ve made
when I find it on the internet.
Maybe it’s just
a short message of appreciation,
perhaps a clarifying question,
or even a mundane query asking
why they did something a certain way.
And, every now and then,
someone does the same for me.
It’s the best feeling in the world
to know that another person out there
shares your curiosity for a subject.
That at least one person
found something you made useful,
and was engaged enough to have questions.

Once I started sending and receiving more emails
I felt I’d gained a superpower.
I can talk to anyone in the world,
whenever I want to!
The feeling of contacting a stranger
on the other side of the world
with whom I share nothing but a single interest
is magical.

Another aspect of email I love
is how simple it can be.
I can use a native mail client I enjoy
with fonts set _just so_
and plain text enabled by default,
all without my choices affecting anyone else.
I love how email is universal.

The next time you’re looking through
some random open source project
and a question bubbles into your head,
consider sending a quick email!
You might
have an interesting conversation
or brighten someone’s day.
